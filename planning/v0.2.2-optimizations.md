# v0.2.2 - Optimizations & Fixes

**Date:** 2025-12-02
**Status:** ✅ Released

## Overview
This release focuses on addressing architectural feedback and optimizing the Hybrid ECS implementation. Key improvements include performance optimizations for the Campaign System and critical bug fixes for the Governing UI.

## Key Changes

### 1. Campaign System Optimization
-   **Problem:** The `CampaignSystem` was iterating through all AI parties every tick to run campaign logic, which poses a performance risk as the game scales.
-   **Solution:** Implemented a **Cooldown Mechanism**.
    -   Added `lastActionTurn` to `TransientStatus` component.
    -   Updated `CampaignSystem` to check this cooldown before executing AI logic.
    -   AI parties now only act once per turn (or less frequently if configured).

### 2. Victory Widget Fixes
-   **Problem:** `VictoryWidget.tsx` contained placeholder functions and unsafe `any` casting, leading to potential runtime crashes and incorrect data display.
-   **Solution:** Refactored to use **ECS Queries**.
    -   Replaced `calculateSeatProjections` with `projectSeats(gameState, partyId)`.
    -   Replaced manual traversal with `getPartyPolling` and `getTotalSeats`.
    -   Removed unused variables and imports.

### 3. Type System Updates
-   Updated `TransientStatus` interface in `src/core/types.ts` to support the new cooldown logic.

## Verification
-   **Performance:** Confirmed AI turns are gated by the cooldown.
-   **UI:** Verified `VictoryWidget` displays correct polling and seat projection data without errors.
