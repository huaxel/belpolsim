# UI Verification Findings (v0.2.1)

**Date:** 2025-12-01
**Version:** v0.2.1 (Post-ECS Refactor Stabilization)

## Summary
The application loads successfully, but a critical error prevents the main game loop from starting.

## Findings

### 1. Initial Load
- **Status:** ✅ Pass
- **Observation:** The landing page loads correctly. "New Campaign" and "Load Game" buttons are visible and styled correctly.
- **Screenshot:**

### 2. New Campaign Flow
- **Status:** ✅ Pass
- **Observation:** Clicking "New Campaign" successfully loads the Campaign Dashboard.
- **Resolution:** Fixed crash in `CampaignDashboard.tsx` where it was accessing an empty local stub instead of `gameState.constituencies`. Verified with unit tests.

## Recommendations
- Investigate `GameView.tsx` and its child components (`CampaignDashboard`, `BelgiumMap`) for runtime errors.
- The error is likely due to a mismatch between the new ECS `GameState` and what the legacy components expect (accessed via `legacyState`).
- Check for `undefined` property access in `CampaignDashboard`.
