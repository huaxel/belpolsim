# Visual Identity & Style Guide: Formateur

## Overall Vibe
**"Elegant Bureaucracy"**
The visual style should feel prestigious, high-stakes, and intellectual. It draws inspiration from high-end political magazines (like *The Economist* or *Monocle*) and modern strategy games (*Suzerain*, *Democracy 4*). It balances the weight of tradition with the clean usability of modern tech.

*   **Keywords:** Authority, Strategy, Tension, Prestige, Clean.

## Color Palette
We use a modernized interpretation of the Belgian colors, grounded in a professional "Dark Mode" or "High-End Paper" aesthetic.

### Primary Colors
*   **Cabinet Charcoal (#1A202C):** The main background color. Deep, serious, and easy on the eyes. Represents the "backrooms" of power.
*   **Royal Gold (#FDC12A):** Used for primary actions, highlights, and the "Formateur" branding. Derived from the Belgian flag but adjusted for digital vibrancy.
*   **Bureaucratic Cream (#F7FAFC):** Used for document backgrounds, cards, and modal windows. A clean, crisp paper tone.

### Functional Colors
*   **Parliament Red (#E30613):** Used for warnings, "Opposition" metrics, and negative budget trends.
*   **Stability Blue (#3182CE):** Used for positive metrics, "Coalition" stability, and information.
*   **Ink Black (#111111):** Primary text color on light backgrounds.

## Typography
A pairing that contrasts tradition with modernity.

*   **Headings (Serif):** *Playfair Display* or *Merriweather*. Used for titles, newspaper headlines, and major event text. evokes history and authority.
*   **Body/UI (Sans-Serif):** *Inter* or *Roboto*. Used for all UI elements, stats, and buttons. Ensures maximum readability and a modern feel.

## Art Style
*   **Minimalist Vector:** Icons and illustrations should be flat, vector-based, and geometric. Avoid hyper-realism.
*   **"The Dossier" Aesthetic:** UI elements should resemble official documents, files, and reports. Shadows should be subtle (like paper lifting off a desk).
*   **Portraits:** Character portraits (Ministers, Party Leaders) should be stylized, perhaps with a "woodcut" or "stipple" effect, or clean vector avatars.

## UI Elements
*   **Buttons:** Sharp corners or slightly rounded (2px). No pill shapes.
*   **Borders:** Thin, elegant borders (1px) in Gold or muted Grey.
*   **Glassmorphism:** Use sparingly, perhaps only for the top navigation bar or tooltips, to add a touch of modern tech.
